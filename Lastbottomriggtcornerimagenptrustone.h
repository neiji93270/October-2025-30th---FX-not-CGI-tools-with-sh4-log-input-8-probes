//so we need a storage device betwren bios and cpus. after that,
//it is best to communicate. so the fx effects are a resultd of ui/ux models.
//we then needs oarcs models to prevent big datas hacks

//intermediate probes could help securing infrared hacks. we have to deal with 8 or 2001 probe.
//then those probes are in danger if ui/ux models or oarc models fail to track internet of things too much times.
